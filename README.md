# Modeling with OpenMesh

This program provides an example of how to create a mesh and use it to visualize data. A simple first order ordinary differential equation is solved using the ODEint C++ library and displayed on a user defined mesh created from OpenMesh C++ libary. The purpose of this is to serve as a starting point to use OpenMesh as a data structure for more complex projects and further research.   

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Operating System

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Virtual Machine)

### Prerequisites

- GNU G++ Compiler
```
$ sudo apt install g++
```
- C++ Boost Libaries
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
### Installing

Run OpenMesh download script to download all libraries and build the most current version. Note: running the script after installation will prompt to uninstall.

```
./OpenMesh_Download
```
Download ODEint libary

```
$ git clone git://github.com/headmyshoulder/odeint-v2
```
